* Design
  Stateful? Stateless?
  Object-Oriented? Functional?

  Maybe make it universal (cl-hackerspace), make it talk to Space API.
  Make Hackerspace a class, with methods providing additional functionalities?
  Hackerspace Krak√≥w could be a subclass then.

* Planned Features
  - switching light(s) on and off
  - querying present users
  - installing callbacks on light and user events
  - open/closed status
  - handling full space api
  - StumpWM integration
